# Why use terminator instead of terminal?

Terminator is a python port of terminal. So in general is more configurable.
One particular use case which works great during development is where one needs to run multiple servers, datastores or services and monitor them individually.

# How
0) Install terminator (sudo apt install terminator)
1) Start terminator
2) Split horizontally and vertically into required number of windows (right click for options)
3) Right click > Preferences > Layouts > Add > Rename > Save (lets say you renamed it to "blog")
4) Open terminator config file: $HOME/.config/terminator/config

5) In the terminal section inside the [blog] section, which looks like below:
```
    [[[terminal2]]]
      order = 0
      parent = child1
      profile = default
      type = Terminal
      uuid = 368f43be-e0ae-4c9c-90ac-7e8a0da56fa9
```

6) Add 2 lines as below
```
    [[[terminal2]]]
      command = cd /home/rane/code/blog/base && source /home/rane/.virtualenvs/blog/bin/activate && python manage.py runserver; zsh
      directory = /home/rane/code/blog/base
      order = 0
      parent = child1
      profile = default
      type = Terminal
      uuid = 368f43be-e0ae-4c9c-90ac-7e8a0da56fa9
```

7) Add other commands to other terminal sections

8) To launch the same layout, with running commands:
```
$ terminator -l blog
```

#### NOTE: This can also be accomplished using  the terminator preferece UI. You can distribute this to others in your team using the config file.
